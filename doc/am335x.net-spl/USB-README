USING UART AND USB
==================

Currently in order to use USB SPL on this platform you must load SPL itself
via UART.  A special build of the board will cause SPL to perform the next
step via USB RNDIS ethernet rather than via UART.

To make this easier, the following build targets have been added:
am335x_evm_uart_usbspl
am335x_evm_restore_flash_usbspl

HOST REQUIREMENTS
=================

In addition to the regular requirements documented in
doc/am335x.net-spl/README to serve files and answer dhcp requests the host
needs to have rndis support (CONFIG_USB_NET_RNDIS_HOST) enabled in the
kernel (built-in or module).  With the default settings, a sample
dhcpd.conf entry would look like:

host am335x_usb_rndis_gadget {
  hardware ethernet aa:bb:cc:00:11:33;

  if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 17) = "AM335x U-Boot SPL" {
    filename "u-boot.img";
  } else {
    filename "uImage-am335x";
  }
  fixed-address 192.168.1.2;
}

In order for this to work, assuming a Linux distribution that obeys
/etc/network/interfaces, the following entry is needed:

allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.1
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	post-up service isc-dhcp-server restart
